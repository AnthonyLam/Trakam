# Microsoft Face API: Python SDK & Sample
This repo contains the Python SDK for the Microsoft Face API, an offering within [Microsoft Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/), formerly known as Project Oxford.

* [Learn about the Face API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/face/)
* [Documentation & API Reference & SDKs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/face/)

## Getting started

Install the module using [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/):

```bash
pip install cognitive_face
```

Use it:

```python
import cognitive_face as CF

KEY = 'subscription key'  # Replace with a valid Subscription Key here.
CF.Key.set(KEY)

BASE_URL = 'https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/face/v1.0/'  # Replace with your regional Base URL
CF.BaseUrl.set(BASE_URL)

img_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/Cognitive-Face-Windows/master/Data/detection1.jpg'
result = CF.face.detect(img_url)
print result
```

### Installing from the source code

```bash
python setup.py install
```

### Running the unit tests

To run the tests you will need a valid subscription. You can get one [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/try/cognitive-services/?api=face-api).

1. Copy `cognitive_face/tests/config.sample.py`  into `cognitive_face/tests/config.py`.
1. Change the `KEY` and `BASE_URL` parameters to your own subscription's API key and endpoint.
1. Run the following:

```bash
python setup.py test
```

## Running the sample

A sample desktop application is also provided.

To run it, install the following prerequisites:

- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3 is **not** currently supported, you can vote for this feature [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/Cognitive-Face-Python/issues/30))
- [wxPython 3.0.2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wxpython/files/wxPython/3.0.2.0/) (version 4 is **not** currently supported)

Then run the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/Cognitive-Face-Python.git
cd Cognitive-Face-Python
pip install -r requirements.txt
python sample
```
